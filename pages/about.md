I am andreadieguez, passionate about design, cinema, and technology, with an academic and professional background that merges diverse disciplines. 

**My innate curiosity to explore new paths and connect different areas of knowledge has been the driving force behind my development.**

Currently, I am immersed in **Web Application Development (WAD)**, delving into technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java**, and tools such as **Oracle Database XE**, **MariaDB**, **SQL*Plus**, **HeidiSQL**, **XAMPP**, **Git**, **GitHub**, **Visual Studio Code**, **JDK**, **JRE**, **Java SDK**, **NetBeans**, and the **Odoo** management system.

My training began in the artistic field, with a degree in **Fine Arts**, **Graphic Design**, and **Audiovisual Communication**, and expanded with a **Master's in Art History** from the University of Salamanca, specializing in Cinematography and the film industry. Later, I embarked on a **PhD in Film and Media Studies**, broadening my perspective on the social and cultural impact of media.

This combination of art, cinema, and technology has strengthened my multidisciplinary vision, allowing me to integrate these fields in innovative ways. I have worked at prestigious national and international film festivals, and in academic projects exploring the intersection between technology and audiovisual storytelling.

Over time, I observed how culture can transform lives, which led me to specialize in **Digital Marketing** and **Data 4.0**, optimizing online strategies and improving project visibility. This combination of skills enables me to merge art, communication, and technology to offer innovative solutions in an increasingly interconnected digital world.

*In summary: In this space, you will find a selection of my latest projects and work, while I continue searching for ways to merge creativity, technology, and communication.*
